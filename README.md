## Description:
CMS-style blog, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. The goal is to provide web devs an application where they can share knowledge, technical concepts and even funny stories.
This app follows the MVC (Models-views-controllers) paradigm in its architectural structure, uses Handlebars.js for its templating language and the express-session npm package for authentication.
